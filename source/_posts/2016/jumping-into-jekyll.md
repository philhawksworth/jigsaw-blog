Today I decided to learn how to use **Jekyll**, the blog-aware, static site generator.

## What For?

Well, the thing is I've always wanted to try out blogging. I'm not particularly aiming to make a popular, successful blog. I just think that blogging is a great way for someone to unload their thoughts, which would be absolutely perfect for me because I'm a person with a very "noisy mind".

## Why Not Wordpress?

The primary reason I didn't want to create a blog with Wordpress is because *it needs a back-end*, which means a server, a database, and those cost money unless of course you decided on free shared hosting services, but that has a lot of drawbacks.

## Why Jekyll?

No back-end and all the potential security risks that come with it, no server costs, and it stays online forever until I decide to take down the GitHub repo. Even though I can't install plugins like with Wordpress that would provide a wider variety of useful features, I wouldn't need to anyway since I just want to keep it simple.

## It's Not for Everyone...

Jekyll isn't something that anyone could just easily build and deploy a blog with. It requires you to know how to use things like the command line, Git and Github, which is usually only familiar to people who write code. Additionally, unlike Wordpress which has a Dashboard, Jekyll doesn't have a user-friendly interface with which to manage your site.

## Now What?

Well, right now I should start writing more posts because if I don't then this will end up being my first and  only post in this blog.
